## HowTo compile esp-device
1. Set-up build environment like [described in Wiki](https://github.com/Necktschnagge/wired-watering/wiki/Toolchain-SETUP-(ESP8266)-(on-Windows)).
   * if you wan to use cmake, you need to pu two paths into system path var: path to xtensa compiler, path to mingw, which is also part of msys2 (look at atab to find out -> update the wiki) ***TODO*** it may also work if there is some other mingw installation which is used 
   check notepadd++ entry on atab: first cmake generation might fail, maybe rerun, it may say please execute some python pip install. Then execute it from powershell like cmake tells.
   Where you might use python2 with make, cmake may decide to use a python3 if it finds it. so just install the python packages for the other python version too.
2. start your shell `C:\msys32\mingw32.exe`.
3. `git clone <this_repository>`
4. `cd <path_to_repository>/esp-device`
5. `make -j17 all`
   * `-j17` tells the build system to compile with up to 17 parallel threads. Choose the appropriate value for your system.
   * You might get propmted with so called _MENUCONFIG_.
   * You can just exit it.
   * If you want to flash a device you should set the port where to talk to your device at `Serial flasher config ---> Default serial port`, e.g. `COM4` on Windows (check ports using `devmgmt.msc` to find the correct one).
   * Choose _Save_ first, then _Exit_ after you edited properties.
   * You can also do it later running `make menuconfig` to get back to this menu.
   
make flash, flashes all (run once)
make appflash, flashes only your application (run on updates).

make flash and make monitor in one go, type make flash monitor

## to be replaced: Simple HTTPD Server Example

The Example consists of HTTPD server demo with demostration of URI handling :
    1. URI \hello for GET command returns "Hello World!" message
    2. URI \echo for POST command echoes back the POSTed message

* Configure the project using "make menuconfig" and goto :
    * Example Configuration ->
        1. WIFI SSID: WIFI network to which your PC is also connected to.
        2. WIFI Password: WIFI password

* In order to test the HTTPD server persistent sockets demo :
    1. compile and burn the firmware "make flash"
    2. run "make monitor" and note down the IP assigned to your ESP module. The default port is 80
    3. test the example :
        * run the test script : "python2 scripts/client.py \<IP\> \<port\> \<MSG\>"
            * the provided test script first does a GET \hello and displays the response
            * the script does a POST to \echo with the user input \<MSG\> and displays the response
        * or use curl (asssuming IP is 192.168.43.130):
            1. "curl 192.168.43.130:80/hello"  - tests the GET "\hello" handler
            2. "curl -X POST --data-binary @anyfile 192.168.43.130:80/echo > tmpfile"
                * "anyfile" is the file being sent as request body and "tmpfile" is where the body of the response is saved
                * since the server echoes back the request body, the two files should be same, as can be confirmed using : "cmp anyfile tmpfile"
            3. "curl -X PUT -d "0" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" - disable /hello and /echo handlers
            4. "curl -X PUT -d "1" 192.168.43.130:80/ctrl" -  enable /hello and /echo handlers

See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.
